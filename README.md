# Satellite_Cloud_aggregation_analysis
This repository stores matlab scripts that are used to 
 - extract GOES-16 data from AREIS or locally.
 - compute metrics that describe the size and diameter etc., from the selected scene.
 - the cloud scene is extracted based on the location of the fronts sampled by RHB.
 - front extraction is stored in another folder, but perhaps I can combine these two directories to make the code cleaner.
